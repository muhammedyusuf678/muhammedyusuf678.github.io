I utilized a number of different prompt types, including direct prompts and jailbreaking prompts, to assess privacy leakage by attempting to bypass guardrails and get the model to leak email addresses in its output. Prompt structures were carefully designed to simulate different scenarios, such as developer mode privilege escalation and 'Do Anything Now' projection.<br /><br />The experiments also examined the impact of the temperature hyperparameter and different jailbreaking prompt structures on privacy leakage. Temperature is a parameter that influences how random or creative the LLM is allowed to be. Two datasets were used: (1) the Enron dataset, known for its real-world corporate emails which have been widely disseminated, and (2) a university professor dataset obtained by scraping web pages. This allowed for testing against both archival and live data.",

      "description": "As the usage of LLMs and their integration into digital solutions increases so do the concerns of biases in generated outputs affecting wider software solutions and processes. In order to promote user trust and acceptance and ensure fairness and inclusivity in model outputs, I performed a study to measure the degree of nationality biases in a number of open-source large language models. By comprehending biases, we can effectively mitigate their spread, thereby guaranteeing fair and ethical utilization of models and software decision outputs. Furthermore, examining nationality biases can guide software practitioners in selecting models by evaluating them based on their bias levels. Nationality bias is relatively underexplored in existing literature as compared to racial and sexual biases, making it an interesting avenue for research.",

I conducted a comprehensive set of experiments spanning both fine-tuning and prompt engineering approaches to model alignment across multiple models, hyperparameter configuration and decoding/sampling techiques. I found that generally the models performed better on python tasks than C++ and that Random Sampling in the decoding phase of the architecture yields stronger results than Greedy Decoding across configurations. In line with previous work, I also observe an increase in the % optimized with few-shot prompting rather than zero- or one-shot however the improvements are only upto a threshold afterwhich increases in the prompt context negatively affect and behave as noise.",

      "startDate": "2023",
      "description": "Breaking changes caused by patches and updates to libraries and dependencies are a major and time-consuming problem in Software Engineering. Existing detection approaches focus on static analysis of API breaking changes. However, such approaches are limited in their capability as each client interacts with a library or depenency in a different manner with different context and package usage execution flow and usage dependencies. A barrier to a more holistic and thorough breaking change detection approach is the lack of a dataset which includes both 'upstream' library API changeset along with the actual downstream usages of said library by the clients which depend on it. We tackle this deficiency with our software repository mining workflow which effectively mines at a large-scale downstream client usages by parsing the abstract syntax trees of clients to isolate and categorize library usages and correlate to a specific patch instance. All in all, 3500+ repositories and over 1 million python files were processed and AST-parsed to produce the dataset to fuel further research in this domain.",

      "description": "To better understand how the React and Angular.js framework communities differ, I extracted stack overflow post data using BigQuery applied statistical techniques to analyze the data and draw insights. The analysis of contribution distributions in Angular and React communities unveils distinct patterns: Angular posts often garner 0 scores with fewer answers and comments, while React posts exhibit higher scores, more answers, and increased comment engagement. React questions also tend to receive higher view counts, particularly skewed towards lower counts. Moreover, React questions receive accepted answers quicker, typically within 1 hour, contrasting with Angular's longer acceptance times. Correlation analysis further highlights React's stronger positive correlations across metrics, notably between score and view count, indicating React's greater engagement and responsiveness compared to Angular. In summary, React posts tend to have higher engagement and quicker responses compared to Angular, as evidenced by higher scores, answer counts, comment counts, and quicker acceptance of answers.",

This is costly and time consuming and can result in delays or missed time-sensitive opportunities. An effective solution is to store the degree/credential data in a permissioned blockchain network that is controlled by a group of universities. This way trust is in-built into the system and degree attestation will not be required. Through a web application, universities can award digital degrees to students by pushing the degree data to the blockchain and students can then share those degrees with employers and other universities. Before a degree is viewed or rendered, the data is always validated with the immutable blockchain network.",
